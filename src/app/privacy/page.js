    title: 'Information We Collect',
    body: [
      'We may collect account details such as name, email address, phone number, company or tenant affiliation, and role-based access information.',
      'We may collect reservation, trip, vehicle, payment, billing, agreement, inspection, issue, and dealership service-lane data needed to operate the platform.',
      'We may collect documents and media uploads such as driver license images, insurance documents, registration documents, inspection photos, issue evidence, and host vehicle photos.',
      'We may collect technical information such as device type, browser, operating system, app wrapper environment, approximate network information, and usage logs.'

    title: 'How We Use Information',
    body: [
      'We use information to authenticate users, operate reservations and loaner workflows, process payments, manage support issues, generate agreements and printouts, and maintain audit history.',
      'We use information to improve product performance, reliability, and security across guest, host, employee, admin, and customer service experiences.',
      'We may use contact information to send booking confirmations, payment links, pre-check-in links, issue updates, vehicle approval requests, host review requests, and other transactional communications.'

    title: 'How Information Is Shared',
    body: [
      'Information may be shared with the tenant or business operating your booking, reservation, dealership, fleet, or marketplace workflow.',
      'Information may be shared with service providers used to operate Ride Fleet, including payment gateways, email providers, cloud hosting providers, document generation services, and storage providers.',
      'Information may be shared when reasonably necessary to resolve disputes, investigate misuse, comply with legal obligations, or protect users, tenants, Ride Fleet, or the public.'
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Payments And Financial Data',
    body: [
      'Ride Fleet may support different payment gateways by tenant. For tenants using Authorize.Net, cardholder payment entry may be completed on Authorize.Net hosted payment pages or other Authorize.Net controlled experiences rather than being stored directly by Ride Fleet.',
      'Ride Fleet does not store full card numbers or card security codes (CVV). Payment card processing is handled by the payment gateway, while Ride Fleet stores operational records such as transaction references, payment status, amount, timestamps, and related reservation or agreement metadata.',
      'When a customer or tenant chooses to save a card on file, Ride Fleet stores gateway-issued profile or token references, such as an Authorize.Net customer profile ID and payment profile ID, so that future authorized charges, refunds, or security deposit holds can be managed through the gateway without storing raw card data in Ride Fleet.',
      'Ride Fleet may also store limited payment descriptors provided by the gateway, such as card type, masked card details, approval or transaction IDs, and status updates needed for customer service, reconciliation, accounting, fraud review, and audit history.'
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Saved Cards And Security Deposit Holds',
    body: [
      'If a customer authorizes a card to be saved on file, the reusable payment credential is stored with the payment gateway, not as full card data inside Ride Fleet.',
      'Authorized tenant staff may use that saved payment credential to place an authorization hold for a security deposit, capture approved charges, release an unused hold, or process refunds when permitted by the gateway, the tenant workflow, and applicable law.',
      'Security deposit holds may appear as pending authorizations with the payment gateway or issuing bank and may be released according to gateway, card-network, or bank timing rules that are outside Ride Fleet direct control.'
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Documents, Photos, And Evidence',
    body: [
      'Documents and uploaded media may be used to complete pre-check-in, verify drivers, review host vehicle approvals, compare inspections, support dispute resolution, and document dealership loaner workflows.',
      'Users should only upload information that is relevant to the workflow they are completing.'
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Data Retention',
    body: [
      'Ride Fleet may retain account, reservation, issue, and loaner records for operational, accounting, compliance, reporting, support, and audit purposes.',
      'Retention periods may vary by tenant, workflow type, legal obligation, or dispute history.'
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Security',
    body: [
      'Ride Fleet uses role-based access controls, tenant scoping, user module access controls, and workflow-level audit logging to help protect platform data.',
      'Payment operations may rely on third-party gateway security controls, hosted payment pages, tokenization, customer payment profiles, and gateway-side authorization workflows to reduce the amount of sensitive card data handled directly by Ride Fleet.',
      'No system can guarantee absolute security, so users and tenants should also protect credentials, devices, uploaded files, and internal access policies.'
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Your Choices',
    body: [
      'Guests, hosts, employees, and tenant administrators may request updates to account or profile information through the business or tenant operating their workflow.',
      'Users may choose whether to continue certain uploads or communications, but some information is required in order to complete reservations, payments, agreements, inspections, vehicle approvals, or support workflows.'

    title: 'Children',
    body: [
      'Ride Fleet is not intended for use by children under the age required to lawfully create accounts, drive vehicles, enter agreements, or complete the underlying business workflow.'

  {
    title: 'International And Tenant-Specific Operations',
    body: [
      'Ride Fleet may support multiple tenants, rooftops, and operators. Data handling practices can vary depending on the tenant configuration, payment provider, geography, and legal obligations that apply to that tenant.'

    title: 'Policy Updates',
    body: [
